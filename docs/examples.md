###[Flare Example](http://lflores.github.com/flare/)
Based on common tree data "flare", and using D3js library, this example shows bubbles grouped in center (force), like earth gravity, with distinct sizes and colors, you can dive into data hierarchy.

###[Evolution Example](http://lflores.github.com/evolution/)
Based on D3js library, this example shows the evolution of bubbles through time, loading data in asynchronous form, under demand. Or you can push play to automate the action.

###[Martian Example](http://lflores.github.com/martian/)(Thanks to [headwins](https://github.com/headwinds))
In the year 2030, we face a new form of global conscription. Since we've ruined our planet, NATO has ordered the remaining population to board the fleet of Dragon class drop ships headed for that distant red rock in the sky which we'll have to now call home. Many are seeking asylum status in Southeast Asia to avoid ruining another planet.

###[Gravity Label](http://jsfiddle.net/6cLpuL7j/)
This fiddle example shows how to configure the component for adaptable label to enabled space

###Colors Changes:
It's easy to change bubble colors, setting points and colors arrays.
